/*The `Solution` class defines a method, `maxScore`, to find the maximum score by splitting a binary string. 
It counts the occurrences of '1' in the string and initializes the counts of '0' and '1'.
Then, it iterates through the string, updating counts based on encountered characters, and calculates the score at each position. 
The maximum score is tracked and returned.
This algorithm efficiently determines the maximum score by iterating through the string and adjusting counts, providing an effective solution for evaluating different split points in the binary string.*/
