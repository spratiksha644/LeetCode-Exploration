/*The Solution class in this Java code defines a method addTwoNumbers to add two non-negative integer linked lists (l1 and l2).
It utilizes a dummy node to construct the result linked list. 
The method iterates through the lists, adding corresponding digits along with any carry from the previous step.
The sum and carry are calculated for each position, and a new node with the digit is appended to the result list.
The iteration continues until both input lists are exhausted, and any remaining carry is considered.
The final linked list represents the sum of the input integers. 
This concise approach efficiently handles the addition of large numbers represented as linked lists, providing a clear and effective algorithm.*/
