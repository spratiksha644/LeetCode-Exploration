/*
The deleteNode method in the provided Java code is designed to delete a node from a singly linked list.
It achieves this by updating the value of the current node to be the same as the next node's value and then updating the next pointer to skip the next node,
effectively removing it from the list. This method works under the assumption that the input node is not the tail of the linked list.*/
