/*
This Java solution computes the diameter of a binary tree efficiently.
It recursively calculates the height of each node in the tree, updating the diameter as it traverses. 
The height function computes the height of each subtree, and the diameter is updated by considering the sum of left and right subtree heights.
At each node, the maximum diameter is updated.
The diameterOfBinaryTree function calls the height function and returns the final diameter.
By traversing the tree once and efficiently updating the diameter, this algorithm accurately computes the diameter of the binary tree.
