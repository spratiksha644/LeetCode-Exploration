/*
The Solution class defines a method, maxWidthOfVerticalArea, to find the maximum width of a vertical area formed by a set of 2D points.
It extracts and sorts the x-coordinates of the points, then iterates through the sorted array to calculate the horizontal distances between consecutive x-coordinates. 
The maximum distance is tracked, and the final result represents the maximum width of the vertical area.
This algorithm efficiently computes the width by sorting and traversing the x-coordinates, providing an effective solution for determining the spread of points along the vertical axis.*/
