/*
The provided Java solution efficiently determines the minimum absolute difference between any two nodes in a binary search tree (BST). 
It utilizes an inorder traversal approach, which ensures that nodes are visited in ascending order.
By recursively traversing the BST and comparing the absolute difference between each node's value and the previously visited node's value, it updates the minimum difference accordingly. 
This method effectively captures all possible pairs of adjacent nodes in the BST, ensuring that the smallest absolute difference is found.
Thus, the algorithm achieves its goal of identifying the minimum absolute difference between any two nodes in the BST.
