/*The Solution class features a buyChoco method that takes an array of chocolate prices (prices) and an amount of money (money).
The method aims to buy two chocolates with the goal of spending as much money as possible without exceeding the available budget.
The algorithm first sorts the array of chocolate prices in ascending order. It then selects the two lowest-priced chocolates and calculates their total cost (sum).
If this total cost is less than or equal to the available money, it calculates the remaining money after the purchase (sum = |sum - money|). 
Otherwise, it returns the original amount of money.
In summary, the method efficiently determines the optimal way to spend money on two chocolates, ensuring the expenditure does not exceed the budget.*/
